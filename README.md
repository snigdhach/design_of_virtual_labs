# design_of_virtual_labs

Introduction of tests involving remote usability and rechability.Designed a GUI using MATLAB and Simulink.
It involves many lab experiments like :
1. Modeling of electromechanical systems with transfer function inputs.
2. Open loop and Closed loop system experiments.
3. Steady state and transient time response analysis.
4. Root locus desig based vlabs
5. Frequency response analysis including Bode and Nyquist plots.

Note: Code coming soon!
